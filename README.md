# JAVA-8AM

This Java program aims to create a simple console-based train ticket booking system.

Key objectives:
- Allow users to book train tickets by entering passenger details, berth preference (UPPER, MIDDLE, LOWER), source, and destination.
- Allocate berths based on preference and availability, and manage a waiting list (WL) when seats are full.
- Enable cancellation of booked tickets using passenger ID, and automatically assign freed berths to waiting list passengers if any.
- Display the current list of booked passengers and passengers in the waiting list.
- Demonstrate practical use of Java collections (ArrayList), user input handling (Scanner), and object-oriented concepts (Passenger class, berth allocation, etc.).

The program models real-world ticket booking scenarios in a simplified way, suitable for learning and demonstration.
